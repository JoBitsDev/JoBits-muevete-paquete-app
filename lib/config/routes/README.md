## Info 
The route folder contains all the files which are based on the application screens navigation code. 
We will be using the package [fluro](https://pub.dev/packages/fluro) to separate our route navigation. 
This folder contains three files: routes.dart, routes_config.dart, routes_handler.dart. 
we can see the fluro package example code to know about each of these files.
